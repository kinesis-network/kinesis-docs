On the demand side, Kinesis Network welcomes all users seeking GPU resources for their applications.

Benefits to Demand Side:

1\ Over 90% Cost Savings: Spend Your Money to Innovate, Not to Compute!
By utilizing otherwise wasted resources, Kinesis Network is perpetually more affordable. We offer a cost saving ranging from 90% to 99% compared to centralized alternatives.

2\ Pay-As-You-Go: Pay for What You Use, Not for What You Reserve! 
When designing capacity, one must not only consider average demand, but also peak demand. This is why most compute resources are over provisioned. The problem is, conventional datacenters charge you monthly, whether you utilize your reserved capacity fully or not. Kinesis Network's serverless architecture charges you for ONLY what you use. Your image might be on hundreds of machines, available for massive demand, yet you are only charged when that demand materializes.

3\ Decentralization and High Availability: Your Applications, Anytime, Anywhere! 
Kinesis Network's decentralized and serverless architecture provides access to resources across the globe. This means that applications can potentially run on ALL resources within the network, safeguarding them against outages in any one region. Additionally, our architecture ensures high availability, allowing your applications to seamlessly handle peak traffic demands.

4\ Environmental Sustainability: Green Computing for a Blue Planet! 
By utilizing our network's underutilized resources, users contribute to reducing e-waste and promoting environmental sustainability.

5\ Access to Diverse Hardware: Hardware, Your Way!
Kinesis Network offers access to a wide range of options for specific applications, ensuring that the models required for unique use cases are readily available. This variety accommodates compatibility needs, performance testing, and research across different manufacturers (e.g., Nvidia, Apple, Intel), platforms (e.g., TPU, GPU, CPU), architectures (e.g., single vs. multi-GPU), and memory types (e.g., VRAM for GPUs, DRAM for CPUs).
