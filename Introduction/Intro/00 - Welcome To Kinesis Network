Kinesis Network captures the power of idle GPUs from all over the world, turning them into a decentralized compute service for AI applications. Just as potential energy awaits conversion to kinetic, these GPUs possess untapped power. We harness this potential and turn it into an affordable, decentralized GPU service for AI applications. Our native token is named the JOULE token (or JUL for short), drawing its name from the unit of energy, symbolizing the transformation and utility of power within our network.
