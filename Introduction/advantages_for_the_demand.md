# Advantages of Kinesis Network over conventional datacenters for the Demand Side

## Cost Savings (Part I): Access to Unused, Therefore Inexpensive Resources
Kinesis Network unlocks access to resources that were originally bought for other uses (e.g. Gaming, 3D design, photo/video production, etc.) but are not fully utilized the whole day. As such, unlike their datacenter cousins, their capital expenditures, safe physical storage, bandwidth, power lines etc. are all paid for already. Their only variable cost is their electricity consumption. This is how Kinesis Network can offer high end compute power at a very low cost. 

## Cost Savings (Part II): Pay for What You Use - Not for What You Reserve
When designing capacity, one must not only consider average demand, but also also peak demand. This is why most compute resources are over provisioned. The problem is, conventional datacenters charge you monthly, whether you utilize your reserved capacity fully or not. Kinesis Network's serverless architecture charges you for ONLY what you use. Your image might be on hundreds of machines, available for massive demand, yet you are only charged when that demand materializes. 

## Decentralized: Redundancy
Our decentralized architecture allows access to resources across the globe. Kinesis Network is a serverless architecture, meaning that your code runs potentially on ALL resources across the network, but also it doesn't run on any particular one at any point. Therefore it protects you against outages in any one region.

## Environmentally Friendly
Most high end GPUs in consumer machines (gaming PCs, etc.) see no more than 1 hour use every day. These valuable resources are wasting the prime of their lives sitting idle most of the day. Kinesis Network unlocks their potential by making them available to the world, preventing colossal waste of valuable resources.
