# Advantages of Kinesis Network over conventional datacenters for the Demand Side

## Decentralized (Part I): Redundancy
Our permissionless and decentralized architecture allows access to resources across the globe. Kinesis Network is a serverless architecture, meaning that your code runs potentially on ALL resources across the network, but also it doesn't run on any particular one at any point. 

## Decentralized (Part II): Democratized Access to World's Resources
You can access to resources across the globe without worrying about availability of them in your country, or if your payment methods are accepted, etc.

## Cost Savings (Part I): Access to Idle, therefore Inexpensive Resources
Kinesis Network unlocks access to resources that were primarily bought for other uses (e.g. Gaming, 3D design, photo/video production, etc.) but are not fully utilized the whole day. As such, unlike their datacenter cousins, their capital expenditures, safe physical storage, bandwidth etc. are all paid for. Their only variable cost is their electricity consumption, which is not much compared to their immense value. This is why Kinesis Network can offer high end compute power at a very low cost. 

## Cost Savings (Part II): Serverless Architecture

## Cost Savings (Part III)

## Environmentally Friendly
Most high end GPUs in consumer machines (gaming PCs, etc.) see no more than 1 hour use every day. These valuable resources are wasting the prime of their lives sitting idle most of the day. Kinesis Network unlocks their potential by making them available to the world, preventing colossal waste of valuable resources.
