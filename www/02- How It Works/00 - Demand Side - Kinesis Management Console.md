For the demand side, the user experience (UX) is as straightforward as any other cloud computing service. We've designed Kinesis Network to seamlessly abstract away the complexities of decentralization and blockchain implementation. Companies seeking GPU resources can follow these simple steps:

1) Create an Account: Start by visiting the Kinesis Management Console at https://portal.kinesis.network and sign up for an account.
2) Prepare Your AI Application: Package your AI application within a Docker image.
3) Upload Your Application: Upload the Docker image to the network through our user-friendly interface.
4) Receive an Endpoint: Once the upload is complete, Kinesis Network will generate a unique endpoint for your application (e.g., https://portal.kinesis.network/myapplication).
5) Start Making Calls: Your AI application is now ready to use. Any call made to the provided endpoint will seamlessly be served by one of our network nodes, ensuring all the necessary application-level Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are met.
