At Kinesis Network, our mission is to drive the AI revolution forward by achieving the following key objectives:

Goal 1: Solving the Cost Problem: We reduce the cost of accessing GPU resources by more than 90%. This increased affordability encourages startups to explore their innovative ideas on the demand side, while also assisting GPU owners worldwide in not only recovering their investments but also generating additional income on the supply side.

Goal 2: Solving the Scarcity Problem: We enable AI developers to access the latest hardware and processing power. Historically, acquiring cutting-edge GPUs in bulk has been a significant challenge due to high demand, resulting in extended wait times with each new model release. This challenge is mitigated as newly released hardware swiftly becomes available within our network, ensuring immediate access for the demand side.

Goal 3: Solving the Centralization Problem: AI applications require substantial computational power, often concentrated in the datacenters of a few large companies. Our approach provides an alternative to centralization of critical GPU resources and enhances privacy, enabling AI companies to operate autonomously with fair and secure access to technology.
